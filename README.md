Semi Automated Centroid Hollow Endosome Tracker
This code processes time lapse images of Endosome movements, transformation, split and fusion events. It relies on 2D projections or optical sections of endosomes and a start seed within the Endosome. The Endosome is treated a as a star-shape topology. and the orientation and center of mass of the Endosome membrane is used to track and describe the Endosome movement.
The code is localization-microscopy capable and hence measures the speed component quite dependably.
